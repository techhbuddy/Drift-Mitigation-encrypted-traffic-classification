Drift Mitigating Self-Learning System for Encrypted Traffic Classification

ðŸŽ“ Course Project

  

This project was developed as part of the Course Project at Vellore Institute of Technology, guided by Aswani Kumar Cherukuri. The aim was to design a self-learning system that mitigates concept drift in encrypted network traffic classification using machine learning techniques.

  

Introduction

In modern network security, encrypted traffic classification is crucial for detecting malicious activities, ensuring QoS (Quality of Service), and maintaining network efficiency. However, traditional machine learning models suffer from concept drift, where the statistical properties of network traffic change over time, leading to degraded model performance.

  

Concept drift occurs due to:

  

Evolving cyber threats (new attack patterns)

  

Changes in user behavior (e.g., increased VPN usage)

  

Updates in encryption protocols (TLS 1.2 â†’ TLS 1.3)

  

Network policy changes (firewall rules, traffic shaping)

  

This project proposes a drift-mitigating self-learning system that continuously adapts to changing traffic patterns while maintaining high classification accuracy. We leverage ensemble learning models (Random Forest & XGBoost) and drift detection mechanisms to ensure robustness against:

  

Gradual Drift (slow changes over time)

  

Sudden Drift (abrupt shifts in traffic behavior)

  

Recurring Drift (periodic pattern changes)

  

By integrating adaptive retraining and concept drift detection, our system ensures long-term reliability in encrypted traffic classification.

  

Machine Learning Algorithms Used

1\. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is highly effective in handling non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data, making it suitable for encrypted traffic classification.

  

Accuracy: 81.6%

  

Strengths:

  

Robust to noise and outliers

  

Handles feature interactions well

  

Less prone to overfitting compared to single decision trees

  

Limitations:

  

Can be computationally expensive for large datasets

  

Struggles with concept drift if not updated

  

2\. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

XGBoost is an advanced gradient boosting framework that optimizes model performance through sequential tree building and regularization. It is highly efficient and widely used in classification tasks.

  

Accuracy: 95.68%

  

Strengths:

  

High predictive accuracy

  

Built-in feature importance analysis

  

Supports parallel processing

  

Limitations:

  

Requires careful hyperparameter tuning

  

Susceptible to concept drift if not adapted

  

Concept Drift Mitigation Strategies

To maintain high accuracy in encrypted traffic classification, we implement the following drift mitigation techniques:

  

1\. Drift Detection Mechanisms

Statistical Process Control (SPC): Monitors prediction errors over time and triggers retraining when error rates exceed a threshold.

  

Adaptive Windowing: Dynamically adjusts the training window to focus on recent data.

  

Ensemble-Based Drift Detection: Uses multiple models to identify shifts in data distribution.

  

2\. Continuous Model Retraining

Incremental Learning: Updates the model with new data without full retraining.

  

Periodic Retraining: Scheduled updates to adapt to gradual changes.

  

Active Learning: Selectively retrains on the most informative samples.

  

3\. Dynamic Feature Adaptation

Feature Importance Tracking: Identifies which features are most affected by drift.

  

Feature Re-weighting: Adjusts feature contributions based on drift impact.

  

4\. Hybrid Ensemble Approach

Combines Random Forest (for stability) and XGBoost (for high accuracy) to balance robustness and performance.

  

Uses weighted voting to prioritize the most reliable model predictions.
